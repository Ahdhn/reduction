## Build 
You might first need to change the project name in the `CMakeLists.txt` and the folder name and fill in any `TODO`. Then simply run 

```
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
```

Depending on the system, this will generate either a `.sln` project on Windows or a `make` file for a Linux system.
